identified within 17 in-demand industry clusters have been added to the
O*NET-SOC taxonomy. The revised taxonomy includes 1102 occupational
titles, 965 of which represent O*NET data-level occupations. Details of
this update and implementation of the O*NET-SOC taxonomy can be found

The current release retains the skills information contained within the

occupations within the 14.0 database is currently being developed. The
new skills information will be included in the O*NET 15.0 database,
targeted for release in June 2010.
